## Black Wings 2024 Hackathon

## Inspiration
We recognize the unique struggles faced by individuals with ADHD or executive functioning challenges, especially when it comes to time management. The inherent difficulties in estimating task durations, remembering scheduled events, and maintaining a consistent focus on priorities can often lead to a sense of overwhelm and frustration.

## What it does
Tau is a revolutionary personal assistant that goes beyond conventional task management. It understands and adapts to an individual's preferred study style, predicts task durations, seamlessly integrates with calendars, and provides analytical insights. Tau not only assists in planning and organizing but also serves as a motivational companion, helping users stay on track and navigate the complexities of their daily lives with confidence.

## How we built it
We developed a web app using React Native and JavaScript. The domain for our app was registered through GoDaddy. 

## Challenges we ran into
In the development process, we delved into exploring the capabilities of GPT for NLP text processing and chatbot integration. However, due to time constraints, we encountered challenges in fully implementing and refining this aspect of our project. Despite our efforts, the integration of GPT for seamless chatbot interaction remains a work in progress.

Additionally, we planned to integrate Google Calendar in Tau but unfortunately, we discovered that Google Calendar integration requires approval.  

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of our ability to build a real react app in a very short time, especially because it was our first time making a react app from scratch.

## What we learned
This was an opportunity for us to delve deeper into GPT and chatbots. Building Tau not only expanded our technical skills but also enhanced our appreciation for the impact these technologies have on creating a better user experience.

## What's next for Tau
Our main priority is to improve and launch the GPT chatbot feature, which will enable smooth and smart conversations. We want to use the power of natural language processing to give users a more natural and customized experience.

We are also working hard to get the permission for Google Calendar feature, which will let Tau connect with users’ calendars and help them manage their tasks more easily. This is very important for us, because we want Tau to be a complete personal assistant that helps users simplify and organize their lives.

Our team is very passionate and committed to making these improvements happen. We are excited to keep supporting people with ADHD with Tau’s new and improved features, which will make it an even more helpful and reliable partner for their success. Stay tuned for more updates as we enter this new and exciting stage of Tau’s journey!
